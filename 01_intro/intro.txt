C++ is superset of C language


C                                                 C++
C is procedural Oriented Programming.             C++ is Object Oriented as well as procedural Oriented
                                                  Supports Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
                                                
No Concept of Exceptional Handling.               C++ Support Exceptional Handling
No type safe linking                              type safe linking
Top Down Approach                                 Bottom up Approach


procedural Oriented Programming - Programming paradigm Some Procedure(Sequence of instruction)
                    is require to accomplish a given task

Object Oriented Programming - popular Programming paradigm(Approach to solve problem) based on concept of object
object - object is something which contain data and code
data in form of field(or attributes, or properties)
code in form of procedural (or methods)

Real world entities are object
class is a description of object
class is a group of variable and object
class is a non-primitive datatype
object is an instace of a class


Different Programming paradigm
